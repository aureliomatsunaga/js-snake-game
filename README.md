A simple Snake game developed in HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, in order to demonstrate a custom **queue** structure using JavaScript, besides having some fun. The process was initially proposed as a college assignment, but stll maintained by me, with rare updates.

There are 2 types of food: The **BLUE** one increases the snake size, adding a block to the end of its body, and the **RED** one removes its very first  block. Both foods, however, always scores +1.
